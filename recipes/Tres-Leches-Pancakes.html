        <h3>Ingredients For The Pancakes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups almond milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, or as needed (optional)</li>
            <li>1 (15.25 oz) box French vanilla cake mix</li>
            <li>3 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/2 cup whipped cream, or as needed (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and half and half in a small saucepan and set over medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. This is a sauce, not a syrup, so consistency will be on the thinner side.</li>
            <li>Add cake mix, almond milk, eggs, and 3 tablespoons vegetable oil to a large bowl, and beat vigorously by hand for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat, and lightly coat with remaining vegetable oil. Add 1/4 cup of the batter for each pancake. Cook until edges begin to puff up, small bubbles appear, pop, and leave small holes, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on the other side, about 2 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Serve pancakes warm with a drizzle of the tres leches sauce, a dollop of whipped cream, and sprinkle of cinnamon.</li>
